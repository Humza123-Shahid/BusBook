üöå Bus Reservation System README
This is a comprehensive bus ticket reservation system built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
You'll need the following installed on your system:

    `Node.js` (version 18 or later is recommended)

    `npm` (Node Package Manager - comes with Node.js) or Yarn

    `MongoDB` (running locally or a connection string for a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

# Installation
1. `Clone the repository:`

    git clone https://github.com/Humza123-Shahid/BusBook.git
    cd BusBook

2. `Install dependencies` for both the client (frontend) and the server (backend) and also for root.

    `Root`:

    cd BusBook
    npm install

    `Backend (Server)`:

    cd server
    npm install

    `Frontend (Client)`:

    cd ../client
    npm install

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Before running the application, you must set up your Constant.

# `Constant`:
    In the server directory, navigate to db.js file.

    Update the following required constant, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

    # MongoDB connection
    const mongoURI="your_mongodb_connection_string_here" also add 'busbook' at the end of string

    In the server directory, navigate to middleware/fetchuser.js file.

    Update the following required constant, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

    # JWT Secret for authentication (make this a long, random string)
    JWT_SECRET="a_very_secret_key"
    **


‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
You need to start both the backend server and the frontend client separately.


`1. Start the Backend Server`
    Navigate to the server directory and run nodemon script:

    cd server
    nodemon ./index.js
    The server should start running at the port specified in your index.js file (e.g., http://localhost:5000).

`2. Start the Frontend Client`
    Open a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory, and run the start script:

    cd ../client
    npm start
    The client should open automatically in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).

    The application is now fully running!

OR
You can run both at the same time.

`Start both Client and Server`

 Navigate to root directory and run the both script:

    cd BusBook
    npm run both
    The server should start running at the port specified in your index file (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
    AND
    The client should open automatically in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).

    The application is now fully running!
